              <h5 style="padding-top: 40px;">Giannis scores 44, leads Bucks' 131-116 win over Lakers</h5>

              <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 44 points on 17-for-20 shooting, and Bobby Portis had 23 points with five 3-pointers in the Milwaukee Bucks' 131-116 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>Khris Middleton scored all of his 21 points in the first half as the defending NBA champions won their fourth straight overall and swept back-to-back games against LA's two teams.</p>
              <p>Antetokounmpo was largely unguardable in the two-time MVP's highest-scoring performance since Nov. 17, getting 14 rebounds and eight assists while making his first 11 shots.</p>  
              <p>''He made it look easy, honestly,'' Middleton said. ''That just shows the level of how he's playing. He was knocking down his jump shot. He's got guys going for his pump fake. Just the way he let the game come to him and stay patient, it was pretty fun to watch.''</p>
              <p>Milwaukee jumped to a 24-point lead in the first half with 70% shooting and led by 30 midway through the third quarter before surviving the Lakers' strong late rally. The Bucks hung on for their third win on a four-game West Coast road trip that ends with an NBA Finals rematch in Phoenix on Thursday.</p>
              <p>''Obviously when you make shots, the game is a lot easier, looks a lot better,'' Antetokounmpo said. ''I know I'm going to try to get my teammates involved and look for the best way to help the team, but sometimes when you start making shots, you feel better about yourself, you defend better. Today was one of those games.''</p>

                <p>LeBron James scored 27 points and Anthony Davis had 22 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who couldn't catch up to the champs even on a rare night with both superstars in their injury-riddled lineup. LA has lost five of seven to fall back to three games below .500.</p>
                <p>Westbrook called the boos ''a sign of respect'' and later said basketball wasn't ''the end-all, be-all... Whatever comes, cheers, boos, it doesn't really matter.''</p>
